# udm-utilities Ansible Role
This role was created out of the need to have better customizability to [udm-utilities](https://github.com/boostchicken-dev/udm-utilities) by [boostchicken](https://github.com/boostchicken-dev).  Files and templates were adapter from there to use in Ansible.  I chose ansible since I have experience in it and it's low barrier to entry (if you're customizing a udm/p you should be able to get your head around this as well).
